# AutoFinder
An application interface designed for purchasing and selling vehicles. The system was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs on Visual Studio Code and it requires "Live Server" an extension in Visual Studio Code through which it opens the interface on a webpage. I have used Safari and Chrome for my implementation.
