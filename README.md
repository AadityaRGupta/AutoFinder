# AutoFinder
An application interface designed for purchasing and selling vehicles. The system is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs on Visual Studio Code and it requires "Live Server" an extension in Visual Studio Code through which it opens the interface on the webpage. I have used Safari and Chrome to check my implementation.
