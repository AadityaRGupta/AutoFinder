# AutoFinder
An application interface designed for purchasing and selling vehicles. The system is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs on Visual Studio Code and opens the webpage. The system requires "Live Server" an extension in Visual Studio Code through which it opens the webpage and displays the screens of the interface. Visual Studio Code updated to the newest version will also show no error and works smoothly. No need to compile as the code might not run, just click on the 'Live Server'. After installing the extension Live Server, open any HTML file and then click on 'Go Live' on the Visual Studio Code. Then, the webpage opens in the default web browser of the system. I personally have used Safari and Chrome to check my implementation.
